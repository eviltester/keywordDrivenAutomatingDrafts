Keyword driven testing example Hobby Project

- explain keyword driven testing with examples
- explain basic parsing: interpreter, text adventures
- keyword driven pros, cons, gotchas
- explain tech we are building on initially - code [x]
- write a keyword driven testing example in code with no external files - code [x]
- read the keywords from a file - tab delimited - code [x]
- read the keywords from an excel file using the excel library Apache POI
- refactor code to use command pattern
- add more 'commands'
- adding assertions
- logging and reporting
- data driven testing vs keyword driven
- add data driven capabilities
- refactor further to make easier to use library interface
- wrap as a 'tool' i.e. main method
- existing keyword driven frameworks overview
- Keywords are a basic DSL, Cucumber is not Keyword Driven
- demo of robot framework
- demo of katalon studio
- demo of karate framework
- advanced keyword driven concepts implemented in commercial and open source tooling

Advanced?
- macro commands built on other commands
- abstract tech - use JSoup, as well as WebDriver (showing differences)

Aims:

- keep it short
- keep it simple
- use basic classes and control structures to make it easier for people with other language experiences to understand
- demystify
